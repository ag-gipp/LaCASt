# LaCASt - A LaTeX Translator for Computer Algebra Systems

# Preface
1. This is a private repository with non-public sources. It is strictly **_prohibited to share_** any files without permission.
2. If you wish to contribute, read the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

## Structure
1. [How to use the program](#howTo)

3. [Team Members](#contributers)

## How to use our program<a name="howTo"></a>
The executable jar for the translator can be found in the `bin` subdirectory. A standalone version can be found in the `bin/*.zip` file. Unzip the archive where you want and run the jar from the root folder of the respository
``` shell script
java -jar bin/latex-to-cas-converter.jar
```

Without additional information, the jar runs as an interactive program. You can start the program to directly trigger
the translation process or set further flags (every flag is optional):
* `-CAS=<NameOfCAS>`: Sets the computer algebra system you want to translate to, e.g., `-CAS=Maple` for Maple;
* `-Expression="<exp>"`: Sets the expression you want to translate. Double qutation marks are mandatory;
* `--clean` or `-c`: Only returns the translated expression without any other information. (since v1.0.1)
* `--debug` or `-d`: Returns extra information for debugging, such as computation time and list of elements. (`--clean` overrides this setting).
* `--extra` or `-x`: Shows further information about translation of functions, e.g., branch cuts, DLMF-links and more. (`--clean` flag overrides this setting)

### Update Translation Patterns
The translation patterns are defined in `libs/ReferenceData/CSVTables`. If you wish to add translation patterns you need to
compile the changes before the translator can use them. To update the translations, use the `lexicon-creator.jar`. Simply run the jar and follow the instructions. It will ask you to enter the names of the CAS you want to update (one CAS per line). If you want to update all at once, just enter `all`. For further information check _[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)_.

### Update Pre-Processing Replacement Rules
The pre-processing replacement rules are defined `config/replacements.yml` and `config/dlmf-replacements.yml`. Each config
contains further explanations how to add replacement rules. The replacement rules are applied without further compilation.
Just change the files to add, modify, or remove rules.

## Round Trip Test Setup<a name="roundtrip"></a>
To run the round trip tests (and symbolic as well as numerical tests), you will find executable jars in the `bin` directory
for all of the tests. The tests require some settings. 

For the tests you have to specify environment variables in order to use CAS engines.
* [config/maple_config.properties](config/maple_config.properties): sets the maple bin directory
``` properties
maple_bin=/opt/maple2016/bin.X86_64_LINUX
```
* [config/mathematica_config.properties](config/mathematica_config.properties): sets the mathematica bin directory
``` properties
mathematica_math=/opt/Wolfram/Executables/math
```

Further you have to set system environment variables.
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH = "$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<Maple-BinDir>:<Mathematica-LibDir>"
export MAPLE="<Maple-Directory>"
```
Where 
* `<Maple-Directory>` points to the directory where you installed your Maple version, e.g., `/opt/maple2016`. 
* `<Maple-BinDir>` points to the binary folder of your installed Maple version, e.g., `/opt/maple2016/bin.X86_64_LINUX`.
* `<Mathematica-LibDir>` points to the system library directory of the Mathematica installation, e.g., 
`/opt/Wolfram/SystemFiles/Links/JLink/SystemFiles/Libraries/Linux-x86-64`. Note that the final directory is system 
dependent, e.g., for Windows it should be `Windows`.

You can fetch the information from Maple when you enter the following commands
```
kernelopts( bindir );   <- returns <Maple-BinDir>
kernelopts( mapledir ); <- returns <Maple-Directory>
```
