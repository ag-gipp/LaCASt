# Enter the command "kernelopts(bindir);" in Maple and put the given path into maple_bin.
# Since this is a java program and \ is an escape character, you have to write \\ for each \.
# In Unix based systems, this is not necessary.
#
# For example, in windows it could looks like this:
# maple_bin=C:\\Program Files\\Maple 2017\\bin.X86_64_WINDOWS
#
# Or in linux it could looks like this:
# maple_bin=/home/maple2016/bin.X86_64_LINUX
