# Define which lines from the dlmf_dataset you want to use for your numerical tests.
# The first line number is 1 (not 0) and start is included, while the end is excluded.
# For example: subset_tests=5,100 will perform numerical tests for the lines 5, 6, ..., 98, 99.
subset_tests=2000,4000

# Define the numerical values you want to test in a list in Maple's 2D input format.
# Note that, if a formula contain multiple variables, such as 'x' and 'y' than the numerical tests
# will perform each combination of variable-value.
# For example, if the formula contains the variables 'x' and 'y' and you set numerical_values=[1,2],
# then the algorithm will test the values: x=1,y=1; x=2,y=1; x=1,y=2; x=2,y=2;
# As an example for 8 values on the unit circle:
# numerical_values=[1, sqrt(2)+sqrt(2)*I, I, sqrt(2)-sqrt(2)*I, -1, -sqrt(2)-sqrt(2)*I, -I, -sqrt(2)+sqrt(2)*I]
numerical_values=[1,I,-1,-I,0]

# Define special variables you want to treat differently from others occurring in
# the test expression. Define the variables as a Maple set, i.e., use {...} and
# the Maple notation for variables.
special_variables={n, m, k, ell, l}

# Treating some variables differently includes to define different values for them.
# The notation is the same as for <numerical_values> above.
special_variables_values=[3]

# Specify to skip a test, if the line contains more variables than the given number.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# In the following you have to specify what you want to test.
# The #LHS, #RHS, #RESULT and #THRESHOLD are placeholders that will be replaced at runtime buy the corresponding values.

# How you want to compare the LHS and RHS. Typical use cases are (#LHS)/(#RHS) or (#LHS)-(#RHS).
test_expression=(#LHS)-(#RHS)

# In some cases, one of the sides is 0. To handle issues with "division by zero" correctly, you should provide
# special test expressions for both cases.
test_if_rhs_null=#LHS
test_if_lhs_null=#RHS

# Define the expected outcome for each value. For example, in case of (#LHS)/(#RHS), the expected value is 1 (+/- machine accuracy).
# In case of (#LHS)/(#RHS), you would test for abs(#RESULT-1) < #THRESHOLD
test_expectation=abs(#RESULT) < #THRESHOLD

# Define the threshold for your tests (floating point value)
test_threshold=0.001

# Define the accuracy that Maple should use for evaluations (integer, high number may increase time)
test_precision=10
