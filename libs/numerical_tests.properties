# Use the following example to perform tests for a subset of lines of the dlmf_dataset.
# You can specify a range with "<startNumber>,<endNumber>". Start number is inclusive,
# while endNumber is exclusive. Means "1,100" will perform tests for lines: 1, ..., 98, 99.
# Note that the 1 is the lowest number, there is no line 0!

# Define the numerical values you want to test. Separate each value by comma and use wrap the
# list in square brackets to create an array in Maple. For example, [1,2,3].
# Note the numerical values should be given in 2D-Maple-Notation (LaTeX macros are not available).
# If you want to use imaginary values, just enter them in 2D-Maple-Notation.
# For example, "3.14-I" or "sqrt(2)+sqrt(2)*I".
